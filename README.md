## Kubernetes Installation Options and Environments

| Environment / Tool | CRI (Container Runtime) | kubectl | Notes |
|--------------------|--------------------------|---------|-------|
| **kubeadm (manual setup)** | ‚ùå Needs to be installed manually (e.g., containerd, CRI-O, Docker shim*) | ‚ùå Needs to be installed manually | Full flexibility, but more complex. Good for learning internals. |
| **kind** | ‚úÖ Included (uses containerd inside Docker containers) | ‚ùå Needs to be installed locally | Runs Kubernetes clusters inside Docker. kubectl must be installed on your host. |
| **k3s** | ‚úÖ Included (lightweight containerd, embedded CRI) | ‚úÖ Included, but often you‚Äôll use your local kubectl with the provided kubeconfig | Very lightweight, optimized for edge/IoT. |
| **minikube** | ‚úÖ Included (supports Docker, containerd, CRI-O) | ‚ùå Needs to be installed locally | Provides a single-node cluster in a VM or container. |
| **GKE / EKS / AKS (Managed Clouds)** | ‚úÖ Included and managed by the provider | ‚ùå Needs to be installed locally | You only need kubectl + kubeconfig to access the cluster. |
